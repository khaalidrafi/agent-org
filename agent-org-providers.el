;;; Commentary:

;; Each provider is a plist:
;;   :id           - symbol (e.g. 'goose)
;;   :name         - human-readable name
;;   :command      - full command line (binary . args), e.g. '("goose" "acp")
;;   :environment  - function returning a list of "VAR=val" strings
;;
;; Add a provider by pushing onto `agent-org-providers'.

`session/load', which is what resume needs; Goose advertises both but
its `session/list' does not answer in practice."
